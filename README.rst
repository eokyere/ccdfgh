In an effort to improve the quality of data submitted to the bureaus and to regularize the type and forms of data submitted by data providers, the Banking Supervision Department of the Bank of Ghana instituted a committee to develop a common reporting template. The committee was made up of Bank of Ghana, the licensed credit bureaus and some selected financial institutions. Draft templates from the committee were discussed with all financial institutions licensed by the Bank of Ghana.

The templates after the necessary amendments were accepted by all bureaus and financial institutions and endorsed by the Bank of Ghana for the limited purpose of data submission to the Credit Reference Bureaus. This manual describes how Data Providers should report credit information on their respective customers to the Credit Bureaus. This format should be used for submitting data on all Consumer Credit data files.

The Credit Bureaus will accept data from the Data Providers, only in the format specified by this document. The Data Providers should read this document carefully before using the Consumer Credit data files Format for the extraction and delivery of data.
This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts and terms related to Consumer Credit data files, data and information systems.
